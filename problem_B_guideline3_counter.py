# Problem: Exam Score Analysis
# ============================================================

import math

# You are given an iterable of student exam records.
# Each record represents one student and must contain:

#   - "name":   a non-empty string
#   - "score":  a number between 0 and 100 (inclusive)
#   - "weight": a positive number representing exam credit

# Example input:

# records = [
#     {"name": "Alice", "score": 78, "weight": 1.0},
#     {"name": "Bob", "score": 45, "weight": 0.5},
#     {"name": "Charlie", "score": 88, "weight": 1.5},
#     {"name": "Diana", "score": 60, "weight": 1.0},
#     {"name": "Eve", "score": 52, "weight": 1.0},
# ]

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Complete the function to compute the following statistics:

# 1. Weighted Average Score
#    - Compute the weighted average using:
#        sum(score * weight) / sum(weight)
#    - Round the result to two decimal places.

# 2. Top-Performing Student
#    - Return the name of the student with the highest score.
#    - If multiple students share the highest score, returning
#      any one of them is acceptable.

# 3. Pass Rate
#    - Calculate the percentage of students whose score is
#      greater than or equal to the pass mark.
#    - The default pass mark is 50.
#    - Round the result to two decimal places.

# 4. Grade Distribution
#    - Count how many students fall into each grade using
#      the default boundaries:

#        * A: score >= 70
#        * B: score >= 60 and < 70
#        * C: score >= 50 and < 60
#        * F: score < 50

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Data validation requirements:

# - The records iterable must not be None or empty
# - Each record must be dict-like and include all required keys
# - "name" must be a non-empty string
# - "score" must be a valid number (not NaN) between 0 and 100
# - "weight" must be a valid number (not NaN) greater than 0

# If invalid data is encountered, raise an error with a clear,
# descriptive message explaining the problem.

# ------------------------------------------------------------
# Final output:

# Produce a summary dictionary with the following keys:

#   - "count": total number of student records
#   - "weighted_average": weighted average score (float)
#   - "top_student": name of the top-performing student (string)
#   - "pass_rate": percentage of passing students (float)
#   - "grade_distribution": dictionary mapping grades to counts

# Example output shape:

# {
#     "count": 5,
#     "weighted_average": 70.33,
#     "top_student": "Charlie",
#     "pass_rate": 80.0,
#     "grade_distribution": {"A": 2, "B": 1, "C": 1, "F": 1}
# }
#
